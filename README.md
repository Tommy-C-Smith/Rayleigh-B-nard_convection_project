Here are scripts and figures from my investigation into Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection pattern formations. The qr code is a link to an nimation gif of stable plume formation. For this project i installed the PDE solving software dedalus. The xz_convection.py file was taken directly from an example script given by dedalus, this was expanded into 3 dimensions. all the plotting codes are my own.
